# UTPB-COSC-4470-Project2
This repo contains the assignment and provided resources for Project 2 of the Applied Network Security class.

## Project Goals:
1) Gain experience with performing a risk assessment.
2) Gain experience working in a group setting on identifying problems and brainstorming solutions.
3) Gain experience understanding valuations and cost-benefit analyses.

## Description:
Each group will be assigned one of the subnets from our hypothetical medium-sized tech business.  You can find the image detailing the full logical map of the business on Canvas under the Risk Assessment module.  Your task will be to perform as complete a risk assessment on all assets within that subnet as you can.  You will be expected to go through the process of submitting a report detailing all mitigations you can come up with for each identified threat/vulnerability along with estimates of the cost to implement each.

## Grading Criteria:
Each group will be expected to complete a full catalogue of assets within their scope, perform valuations of each asset, identify as many threats as possible which may impact each asset, determine the vulnerabilities which may be present, predict likelihood and consequence for each threat, compute risks, and suggest one or more possible mitigations for each risk along with estimates for cost to implement the mitigations.  For specific numbers which you will need to complete things like valuations, frequency estimates, and implementation costs provide me with a list and I will help to generate realistic numbers.

## Deliverables:
Each group will produce a complete risk assessment report, including all of the features listed above.  The length of the final document will depend upon the completeness of the analysis, but is likely to be dozens of pages.  Again, I'm not placing any specific length minima or maxima requirements, but I do want you to try to be as thorough and complete as possible.

## Group Assignments:
The assignments of subnets to each group are as follows:

### Group 1
 * Sales Dept

### Group 2
 * IT Dept

### Group 3
 * Tech Support

## Due Dates:
 * Final drafts will be downloaded from your github repos on May 9th at 23:59:59.
