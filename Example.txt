  vulnerabilities
    lack of insurance
	lack of alternative power
	lack of alternative connectivity
	failure to maintain complete and recent backups
	failure to airgap backups
	failure to maintain failover redundancies
	failure to adhere to security policy
	lack of updated/comprehensive security policy
	poor physical security policy/practice
	poor employee training or failure to adequately audit
	inadequate incident response planning or poor implementation
  mitigations
    lack of insurance
	  work with procurement to ensure adequate insurance is obtained
	  estimated cost: $10k+
	lack of alternative power
	  purchase and set up battery backups and generation infrastructure
	  estimated cost: $5k+
	lack of alternative connectivity
	  find a second provider and obtain a contract
	  if our primary ISP is terrestrial, our secondary should be radio
	  estimated cost: $100+/mo
	failure to maintain complete and recent backups
	  write policy for maintaining backups on at least a weekly basis
	  ensure that the policy is adhered to
	  estimated cost: $8k+
	failure to airgap backups
	  the backup policy should specify that the backups are stored on non-volatile media in an offline manner
	  estimated cost: $2k+
	failure to maintain failover redundancies
	  our secondary server need not fully replicate the functionality of the primary, only what is necessary to take over and complete ongoing tasks
	  the secondary must not be identical to the primary at least in terms of OS/software versions (usually one major version behind)
	  estimated cost: $5k+
	failure to adhere to security policy
	lack of updated/comprehensive security policy
	poor physical security policy/practice
	poor employee training or failure to adequately audit
	inadequate incident response planning or poor implementation
